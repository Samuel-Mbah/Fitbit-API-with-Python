Fitbit API Data Retrieval with Python

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to interact with the Fitbit API to retrieve heart rate and step count data from a user's Fitbit account. By leveraging the Fitbit API's OAuth 2.0 authentication flow and data retrieval endpoints, this script provides an easy-to-follow example of how to access and utilize health-related data for further analysis or integration into applications.

**Features:**
- Step-by-step guide on the Fitbit Developers Site on setting up API credentials and OAuth 2.0 authentication.
- Python script showcasing the usage of the Fitbit API to retrieve heart rate and step count data.
- Clear code structure and comments to aid in understanding and customization.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the guide in the Fitbit developers page to create a Fitbit Developer application and obtain API credentials.
3. Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
4. Modify the script `FITBIT_INTRADAY_HEART_RATE` or `FITBIT_STEP_COUNT_DATA` to include your API credentials.
5. Run the script to retrieve heart rate and step count data.

**Usage:**
- Explore the retrieved data for personal analysis or integrate it into your applications.
- Extend the script to fetch additional health metrics offered by the Fitbit API.
- Customize the data processing and visualization in the provided Jupyter Notebook.

**Note:**
- This project serves as a learning resource and starting point for Fitbit API integration.
- Be mindful of Fitbit API rate limits and data privacy considerations.
